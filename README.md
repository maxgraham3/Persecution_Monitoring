# Persecution Monitoring

In order to reduce religious persecution and violence, interested parties - e.g. relief organizations, para-church organizations, churches, etc. - must have a reliable situational awareness of what events are happening in their areas of interest.  This package includes an ontology built around churches, dioceses, communions/denominations, individuals, as well as incident reports. The apps include a Church Monitoring App and an Incident Report Feed Viewer.  An AIP Logic function enables the user to compare individual church details with the set of open source incident reports to see which reports are most pertinent base on location.
